# Solana Vote App Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple voting smart contract built for the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. 
The contract was initially developed and deployed on Solana Playground and later ported to a local Anchor environment in VS Code (`lib.rs`).

## Features
- Register candidate
- Register voter
- Cast vote

- ## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Install Solana CLI and Anchor CLI
3. Run `anchor build` to compile the program
4. Deploy with `anchor deploy` to localnet or devnet
5. Use Anchor tests or your own frontend to interact with the program

## Tech Stack
- Rust (smart contract logic)
- Anchor framework (Solana smart contract development)
- Solana CLI and Anchor CLI for deployment and testing


## YouTube Tutorial
I have created a detailed video walkthrough explaining the development and deployment process of this Vote app smart contract in solana playground.
