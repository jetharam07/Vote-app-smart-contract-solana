# Solana Vote App Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple voting smart contract built for the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. 
The contract was initially developed, deployed and tested on Solana Playground and later ported to a local Anchor environment in VS Code (`lib.rs`).
